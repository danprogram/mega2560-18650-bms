# mega2560-18650-bms

A battery management system using the arduino mega 2560 

Eventually this project would aim to make a fully functional Battery Management System based off the Arduino / ATmega2560.
 The project would be an open source harware and software solution
 The BMS would ideally be fully capable of :
      Voltage readings of each cell
      Temperature readings of each cell
      Amperage readings on both charge and drain directions 
      Charging and draining both in bulk and of individual cells
      software balancing of individual cells
